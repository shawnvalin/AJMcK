          <h3>About AJ</h3>
            <p>AJ's love for art started as a child, when she would happily pour bottles of (very stinky) nail polish over whatever "canvas" (read: furniture) was readily available.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Her family immediately saw her creativity, but also noticed the mess! They decided that a noisy child was better than a messy child, and sent her on the greatest whirlwind of her life through the clarinet, the saxophone, and her most beloved, the bassoon.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              She never really lost sight of that vision, though, and was often known to close her eyes while listening or playing music, to enjoy the cacophony of visions which danced through her mind any time a beautiful (or even hideous) sound was made. 
              <br/>
              <br/>
              However, when she became very ill in 2009 and was advised by doctors and mentors to put down the instrument she had become so enamored with, she was heartbroken. It was then, one very late evening when her symptoms were keeping her awake, that she became reunited with the visual media. The harmony of colors, and the expressiveness of the media became an instant escape from a world of pain and illness.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              On towards a journey through photography, acrylics, watercolor, and finally (or at least for the moment) illustration, AJ has trekked through the art world, leaving practically no stone left unturned. Never a person who can settle for one "style" or "theme" she flits here and there, in a manner that much reflects the tune of her life, consistently across all the dimensions of art.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              AJ's whimsical characters and phantasmagorical landscapes have provided her solace and healing in the past few years, and she doesn't plan to stop now. So come and step into her world, where all can find love and healing.
              <br/>
              <br/>
            </p> 
            <a name="readmore" class="anchorlink"><h3>Art as Healing</h3>
            <p>AJ's journey of using visual art to heal emotional wounds began with a three year struggle with a severe and mysterious chronic illness that marred her ability to function from 2009-2012.
              <br/>
              <br/>
               Now healthier than ever, AJ is spreading her story of overcoming obstacles, healing, and hope to all who struggle with mental or physical obstacles (or as AJ prefers, "opportunities" in their lives).
               <br/>
               <br/>
               Living by the mantra "Never give up" taught AJ to be all that she can be and to ignite her inner flame. So step into our world, and walk with me as we all learn to love more, dream more, and be more.
               <br/>
